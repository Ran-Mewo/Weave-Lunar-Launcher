# Weave Launcher for Lunar CLient
This is a simple launcher for Lunar Client that allows you to use Weave Loader within.\
It shouldn't need many updates so expect this repository to be sort of dead.

If people want I can make it support more Minecraft clients

## Usage
- Only tested on Linux. (also it works for the flatpak version of Lunar Client)\
Launch Lunar Client and then run the application

For flatpak, remember to use Flatseal to expose `~/.weave` to the flatpak sandbox.
